        <h1>About the Artist</h1>
        <p>Hello! Thanks for stopping by. I am Angela Lewis, a self-taught
            artist in Utah creating mixed media
            pieces. My formal education is in psychology and elementary
            education
            with training in applied behavioral analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion for art started with my Grams, Grandma
            Ramona: not just during arts and craft times, but through Ramona's
            love for sewing her own clothing. Gram's clothes were
            always carefully crafted with curated, surface pattern designed
            fabrics. She adored polka dots, florals, and repeat patterns
            bordering solid prints. Soon, my own admiration of those fabrics
            spread to admiration of graffiti art in the neighborhoods around
            me, the architural structures on family vacations, and
            classic art pieces at museums. My curiosity and cleverness has led
            to experiences with a multitude of art forms. I delight in
            acrylic painting, watercolor, colored pencil art, lino cuts, mixed
            media, and digital art. Hours of YouTube tutorials, reading
            through books, and honest attempts have helped hone my skills
            to date.
        </p>

        <p>I am passionate about and inspired by:</p>
        <ul id="inspirations">
            <li>the cultures of Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.</li>
            <li>vibrant colors and color therapy.</li>
            <li>women empowerment.</li>
            <li>floral and fauna.</li>
            <li>nostalgic movie characters and scenes from the '80s and '90s.
            </li>
            <li>fantasy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of my pieces tell a story bringing awareness, reviving a
            memory, or being playful.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not creating or collecting inspirational photos, I am
            enjoying life with my two boys. I love baking,
            cooking, nature walks, watching movies (cult
            classics and horror are among the favorites), listening
            to music, and playing video games.
