    <h1>About the Artist</h1>
    <p>Angela Lewis is a self taught artist in Utah creating mixed media
        pieces. Her formal education is in psychology, elementary education,
        with training in applied behavioral analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her passion for art started with her Grandma
        Ramona: not just during arts and craft times, but through Ramona's love
        for sewing her own clothing. Ramona's clothes were
        always carefully crafted with curated, surface pattern designed
        fabrics. Ramona adored polka dots, florals, or repeat patterns bordering
        solid prints. Soon, Angela's admiration of those fabrics
        spread to admiration of graffiti art in the neighborhoods around
        her, the architural structures on family vacations, and
        classic art pieces at museums. Angela's curiosity and cleverness led
        to experiences with a multitude of art forms. She delights in acrylic
        painting, watercolor, colored pencil art, lino cuts, and digital art for
        mixed media art pieces. Hours of
        youtube tutorials and reading through books has helped her hone skills
        to date.
    </p>

    <p>She has passion for and is inspired by:</p>
    <ul id="inspirations">
        <li>the cultures of Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.</li>
        <li>vibrant colors and color therapy.</li>
        <li>women empowerment.</li>
        <li>floral and fauna.</li>
        <li>nostaligic movie characters and scenes from the '80s and '90s.
        </li>
        <li>fantasy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of her pieces tell a story bringing awareness, reviving a memory, or
        being playful.
    </p>
    <p>
        When she is not creating or collecting inspiration photos, she is
        enjoying life with her two boys. She takes pleasure in baking, cooking,
        nature walks, and watching
        movies (cult classics and horror are among the favorites).
