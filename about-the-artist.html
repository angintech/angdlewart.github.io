        <h1>About the Artist</h1>
        <p>Angela Lewis is a self taught artist in Utah creating mixed media
            pieces. Her formal education is in psychology, elementary education,
            with training in applied behavioral analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her passion for art started with her Grandma
            Ramona: not just during arts and craft times, but through Ramona's
            love
            for sewing her own clothing. Ramona's clothes were
            always carefully crafted with curated, surface pattern designed
            fabrics. Ramona adored polka dots, florals, or repeat patterns
            bordering
            solid prints. Soon, Angela's admiration of those fabrics
            spread to admiration of graffiti art in the neighborhoods around
            her, the architural structures on family vacations, and
            classic art pieces at museums. Angela's curiosity and cleverness led
            to experiences with a multitude of art forms. She delights in
            acrylic
            painting, watercolor, colored pencil art, lino cuts, and digital art
            for
            mixed media art pieces. Hours of
            youtube tutorials and reading through books has helped her hone
            skills
            to date.
        </p>

        <p>She has passion for and is inspired by:</p>
        <ul id="inspirations">
            <li>the cultures of Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.</li>
            <li>vibrant colors and color therapy.</li>
            <li>women empowerment.</li>
            <li>floral and fauna.</li>
            <li>nostaligic movie characters and scenes from the '80s and '90s.
            </li>
            <li>fantasy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of her pieces tell a story bringing awareness, reviving a
            memory, or
            being playful.
        </p>
        <p>
            When she is not creating or collecting inspiration photos, she is
            enjoying life with her two boys. She takes pleasure in baking,
            cooking,
            nature walks, and watching
            movies (cult classics and horror are among the favorites).
