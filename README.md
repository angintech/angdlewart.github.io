first website build in Tech-Moms program
I am thrilled about pivoting into the technology field. I found the program Tech-Moms in my search for ways to dive in. It is a 10 week program with one week off, one presentation week, and all the other weeks are about learning html, CSS, and basics of JavaScript to develop your own webpage by the end. This is my webpage, an art portfolio.
